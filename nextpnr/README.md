### Status
Running `simple.sh` results in a complete flow from Verilog to binary bitstream.  However it is not yet blinking anything when uploaded to the AG1KLPQ48.

### Files
* [simple.py](simple.py) Creates the BELs, PIPs and wires for nextpnr.  Utilizes files in the [bitstream](../bitstream) directory: [chips.py](../bitstream/chips.py), [tiles.py](../bitstream/tiles.py), [wires.py](../bitstream/wires.py).  The resulting routing looks sensible, e.g. [log, starting at line 3379](log#L3379) and the IOTILEs appear to be configured correctly.
* [write_fasm.py](write_fasm.py) Mostly a copy of the same file from nextpnr: Does some mild transformation to PIP and BEL names to make them fasm compliant
* [fasm_pack.py](fasm_pack.py) Reads in a fasm file generated by nextpnr-generic.  Emits a textual bitstream that can be turned into a binary via [agm-pack.py](../bitstream/agm-pack.py)
* [blinky-explain.txt](blinky-explain.txt) The result of [agm-unpack.py](../bitstream/agm-unpack.py) and [agm-explain.py](../bitstream/agm-explain.py) against the binary bitstream created in [simple.sh](simple.sh).  Used for sanity checks, and to compare against a similar file created from an `af` generated bitstream: [Blinky_explain.txt](../examples/blinky/output/Blinky_explain.txt)

### Open questions
* I haven't looked at the generated LUTs
* I don't understand the behavior of LUTCMUX – looking at the af bitstream, it appears to be 2'b10 when a slice OMUX is set to Q instead of LutOut
* In the af bitstream, when a LogicTILE's TileClkMUX is used, the corresponding TileAsyncMUX appears to get set to 4'b0001
* In the af bitstream, some IOTILE's have their seemingly unused IOMUXes set to 7'b0000001.
