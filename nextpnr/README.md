### Status
Running `build.sh` results in a complete flow from Verilog to binary bitstream.  

* `simple.v` sets LED outputs to 1'b0, 1'b1 and clk.  When uploaded to the FPGA it executes as expected.
* `blinky.v` Not yet blinking... 

### Files
* [simple.py](simple.py) Creates the BELs, PIPs and wires for nextpnr.  Utilizes files in the [bitstream](../bitstream) directory: [chips.py](../bitstream/chips.py), [tiles.py](../bitstream/tiles.py), [wires.py](../bitstream/wires.py).  The resulting routing looks sensible, e.g. [build-blinky/log, starting at line 5451](build-blinky/log#L5451) and the IOTILEs appear to be configured correctly.
* [write_fasm.py](write_fasm.py) Mostly a copy of the same file from nextpnr: Does some mild transformation to PIP and BEL names to make them fasm compliant
* [fasm_pack.py](fasm_pack.py) Reads in a fasm file generated by nextpnr-generic.  Emits a textual bitstream that can be turned into a binary via [agm-pack.py](../bitstream/agm-pack.py)
* [build-blinky/blinky-explain.txt](build-blinky/blinky-explain.txt) The result of [agm-unpack.py](../bitstream/agm-unpack.py) and [agm-explain.py](../bitstream/agm-explain.py) against the binary bitstream created in [simple.sh](simple.sh).  Used for sanity checks, and to compare against a similar file created from an `af` generated bitstream: [Blinky_explain.txt](../examples/blinky/output/Blinky_explain.txt)
